# ThreadzThis project demonstrates the use of a `DispatchGroup` to asynchronously download story titles from HackerNews. The UI is updated on `DispatchQueue.main` (1) after each individual story's title is loaded (on the left), and (2) upon completion of all 10 title's being loaded (displays them in order on the right).A mutable array `titles` is also updated on `DispatchQueue.main` after each title is loaded because it is not thread safe.
