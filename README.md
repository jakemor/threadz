# ThreadzThis project demonstrates the use of a DispatchGroup to asynchronously download story titles from HackerNews. The UI is updated on the main thread (1) after each individual story's title is loaded (on the left), and (2) upon completion of all 10 title's being loaded (displays them in order on the right).A mutable array titles, and the UI are only modified on the main thread.
